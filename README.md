# Coaching-Institute-SQL-Project
I have done a dummy Project in which I created a comprehensive database for a coaching institute using My SQL. 
It helped me in getting a better understanding and practical experience of things I have learnt in class. 
I created tables for tutors, students, tests held, inserted dummy values in them followed by calculating attendances, test scores for the users involved with the coaching institute.
I joined the tables using join queries , applied constraints like autoincrement, primary key etc, applied subqueries as well as aggregate functions.
